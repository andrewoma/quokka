<h1>What is Quokka?</h1>

<p>Quokka is a software build system, focusing on reproducible, modular builds
    with fine-grained dependency management. Quokka is implemented using Java and initially focuses
    on supporting Java-based projects and tools.
</p>
<p>
    For Java developers, quokka provides an <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>-based
    alternative to <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>. See <a href="quokka-vs-maven.html">Quokka vs Maven</a>
    for a comparison.
</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<dl>
    <dt><b>Modular Builds</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Build tasks such as compilation, or source code formatting are packaged into <i>plugins</i>. Each
        project can be tailored to include specific plugins as required.
        <br/><br/>
        Build configurations (including plugins, dependencies and other resources) can be bundled
        into a <i>dependency set</i> for re-use amongst projects. For example, a dependency
        set could be defined to add Checksytle processing to your project, along with your tailored checkstyle
        configuration file. Projects can include any number of such dependency sets, and sets may nest other
        sets within them, providing varying degrees of reuse.
    </dd>
    <br/>
    <dt><b>Fine-grained Dependency Management</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Quokka allows any number of paths of dependencies to be defined for use within a project. Selected paths can
        also be exported to the repository for reuse within other projects. If your project depends on another project,
        quokka can automatically include dependencies of your dependencies recursively. In such cases you have full
        control down to any level as to which dependencies are included.
    </dd>
    <br/>
    <dt><b>Extensibility</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Quokka projects can be extended using both plugins and standard Ant scripts. The plugin architecture allows
        plugins to interact with one another. For example, the life cycle plugin defines an abstract "test" target which
        is implemented by both the jUnit and TestNG plugins - you just pick the implementation for your project.
        Furthermore, explicit SPIs have been defined to extend quokka programatically, including the Plugin and
        Repository SPIs.
    </dd>
    <br/>
    <dt><b>Reproducible Builds</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Quokka combines several features to make builds reproducible. Reproducible means that if a given revision of
        your project built with quokka in the past, it should be possible to build it today with exactly the same
        result. The following features make this possible:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bootstrapping:</b>
                A project can be configured to use a specific version of quokka and jvm. Quokka will then fork the
                required environment automatically.
            </li>
            <li><b>Versioned global repository:</b>
                Once an artifact, such as a .jar, is stored in the global repository, it and any metadata associated
                with it can never change. If corrections are required, they will be stored as a separate revision. This
                guarantees a reference to a given dependency will not change over time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Project repository: </b>
                For even greater safety, some or all artifacts can be stored with the project in version control in a
                local project repository.
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugins do not automatically upgrade themselves: </b>
                Unlike Maven, quokka plugins do not automatically upgrade themselves. You must specify the version of a
                plugin to use and it remains constant.
            </li>
            <li><b>Release plugin:</b>
                The release plugin provides additional checks upon releasing and tagging your code, including ensuring
                that bootstrapping is configured and there are no snapshot dependencies.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Profiles:</b>
        Profiles can be used to enable certain features, or change configurations for a given project. Profiles
        might include "dev" and "prod" for configuring a .war file for development and production environments
        respectively. There are also automatic
        profiles based on property values. For example, if you set your java source level to 1.5, the jUnit
        plugin will automatically select jUnit 4.x, instead of 3.x.
    </li>
    <li><b>IDE integration:</b>
        Quokka is implemented as a transparent extension to ANT. There have been no modifications to ANT at all
        to implement quokka. As such, existing IDE integration for ANT works with quokka by default (or can be
        configured to do so).
    </li>
    <li><b>Extensions:</b>
        A wide range of extensions are available for quokka already, with the list growing rapidly. See the
        <a href="extensions.html">extensions</a> page for more information on available plugins, archetypes
        and XML catalogues.
    </li>
