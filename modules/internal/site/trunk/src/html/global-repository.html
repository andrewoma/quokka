<h1>Global Repository</h1>

<p>Quokka makes use of a global repository for artifacts, such as .jar files. The main reason for it is so
    that common libraries have well known ids. This enables quokka to detect class path conflicts
    between libraries. It also has the advantage that common libaries need to be downloaded only once.
</p>

<h2><a name="accessing"><span/></a>Accessing the Global Repository</h2>

<p>
    The default quokka installation is configured to access the global repository automatically.
    However, you can browse the repository at <a href="http://quokka.ws/repository/">http://quokka.ws/repository/</a>
</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> The global repository artifacts and repository data will not be frozen until
quokka 1.0 is released. After 1.0 all repository artifacts will be immutable and any modifications
will result in a new revision in the repository.</p>

<h2>What if my library is not in the Global Repository?</h2>

<p> There are 2 options: </p>
<ul>
    <li>You may attempt to add it to the Global Repository.<br/>
        <b>Note:</b> While quokka is in beta the
        only .jars accepted into the global repository will be those required by quokka itself ant its extensions
        such as plugins. This is both to reduce the impact on users should the repository structure
        change in an incompatible way, and also pending a process to management the global repository in
        a distributed manner.
    </li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can configure a local project repository. This allows you
        to place the jars along side your source under version control. Or if you are in a corporate environment,
        you may configure a corporate-wide repository. The key point is that you do not need to have all your
        dependencies in the global repository to use quokka.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="standards"><span/></a>Naming Standards</h2>

<p>If you ever intend to submit libraries to the global repository, or wish to migrate to the global
    repository versions when they become available, the must adhere to the
    <a href="repositories.html#naming-standards">naming standards</a>.</p>

<!--
<p><b>Once an artifact is deployed to the Global Repository it cannot be changed.</b>
If a mistake has been made, the a separate revision must be provided.</p>

<p>If you aren't turned off by the above requirements, feel free create an issue assigned to the "global-repository"
    component and attach the zipped up repository entries.</p>

<p>When time permits, a maintenance system will be put in place to allow automated submission and approvals.
At this point, submissions may be relaxed somewhat.</p>
