<h1>Global Repository</h1>

<p>Quokka makes use of a global repository for artifacts, such as .jar files. The main reason for it is so
    that common libraries have well known ids. This enables quokka to detect class path conflicts
    between libraries. It also has the advantage that common libaries need to be downloaded only once.
</p>

<h2><a name="accessing"><span/></a>Accessing the Global Repository</h2>

<p>
    The default quokka installation is configured to access the global repository automatically.
    However, you can browse the repository at <a href="http://quokka.ws/repository/0.2">http://quokka.ws/repository/0.2</a>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Once an artifact is in the global repository, it will not change. Should repository
changes be desired or necessary, the existing artifacts will be migrated to the new repository
layout under a different URL.</p>

<h2>What if my library is not in the Global Repository?</h2>

<p>The User Guide has fairly comprehensive coverage of the options. See the section
on <a href="repositories.html#installing-libs">Installing 3rd Pary Libraries</a>. If you want
to upload to the global repository, make sure you check out the <a href="repositories.html#naming-standards">Naming Standards</a>
and <a href="repositories.html#uploading">Uploading</a> sub-sections.</p>
