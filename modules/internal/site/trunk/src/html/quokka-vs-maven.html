<h1>Quokka vs Maven</h1>

<!--<p>Quokka is a plugin and dependency management extension for ANT. Essentially, it provides an ANT-based-->
<!--alternative to Maven, focusing on flexibility, reproducibilty and fine-grained dependency management.</p>-->

<h2>Key advantages of Quokka:</h2>

<h3>Usability</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Humane, validated XML:</b> Quokka's project files make extensive use of attributes and provide
        shorthand notations for many cases. Also, unlike maven, quokka project files do not contain arbitrary
        configuration elements and can be validated against a DTD.
        <br/>TODO: Compare a like for like project (pom.xml vs build-quokka.xml)
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Detailed Project Help:</b>
        Quokka's help plugin provides a <b>very</b> comprehensive HTML report for a project showing all
        dependencies, paths, targets and properties. See the following <a href="help-example/help.html">example</a>
        for the project that generates this site.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Plugins bind themselves automatically by default:</b>
        Quokka's plugin architecture allows a plugin to implement an abstract target defined in another
        plugin. For example, the lifecycle plugin defines an abstract target "compile", which is implemented
        by the javac plugin. When using the javac plugin, it automatically binds itself "compile". Maven on the
        other hand requires the user to specify what phase a goal is bound to manually.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Coherent site &amp; documentation:</b> While still a work in progress, quokka provides a coherent
        site and set of documentation. Furthermore, plugin documentation is available for all versions of plugins,
        not just the latest version (historical versions of the core documentations are also available).
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Dependency handling:</b> Quokka allows transitive dependencies to be marked as mandatory or
        optional. By default, only mandatory transitive dependencies are included with a convenient
        shorthand notation for specifiying options. This fine control is via
        "path specifications" that allow a graph of dependencies to be specified. e.g. A fictious
        example of "testng(qdox(log4j), bsh)" might represent that you require the testng dependency along with
        the qdox dependency of it, it's log4j dependency, etc. This fine level of control also applies to plugin
        dependencies. In contrast, Maven includes everything by default and only supports simple exclusions.
        It appears to be impossible to exclude dependencies of plugins.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Global JDK configuration:</b> JDK source and target levels can be specified globally
        and all plugins that are JDK aware, such as javac and javadoc will pick up the configuration
        automatically. Furthermore, some plugins such as jUnit will select the version of their
        dependencies automatically (in this case jUnit 3.x for JDKs &lt; 1.5 and 4.x otherwise).
        The default heap size for forked JVMs can also be set globally.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Aggregated reports:</b>
        All reports currently available for quokka support aggregation into a single report when doing
        multi-project builds. TODO ... check current status of maven aggregated reports.
    </li>
    <li><b>Repository management: </b> Quokka can statically determine all dependencies used by a project.
        This combined with a repository API that allows browsing and deletion of dependencies from a
        repository, it is possbile to prune "dead" artifacts from repositories automatically. Note: the
        pruning functionality has not been implemented yet, but the underlying building blocks have. In contrast,
        maven repositories tend to grow unmanaged as there are no tools to analyse them.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility/Flexibility</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>No hard-wired notion of a lifecycle in the core:</b>
        Nothing regarding the lifecycle plugin, including the targets and paths it uses it hard-wired
        into the core. It is just a normal plugin, contributing abstract targets and default path
        definitions. The plugin architecture is powerful enough to support this functionality. It also
        means it is possbile for other plugins to introduce additional paths and abstract targets. For example,
        an EAR plugin could introduce an "ear" path that would be used to specifiy the libraries bundled into
        the EAR lib directory.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Multiple artifacts per project:</b> The quokka core supports multiple artifacts per project.
        Support for multiple artifacts is dependent on particular plugin implementations,
        however it is common for plugins to support multiple artifacts for packaging. e.g. the Jar plugin
        allows any number of .jar artifacts to be built from a single project, however the Javac plugin
        only supports compiling all source files as a single unit. In constrast, Maven only supports a
        single artifact explicitly and then relies on specific plugins to handle special cases
        such as remote interfaces for EJBs.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Custom paths from the repository:</b> Projects can define their own custom paths and add any artifacts
        from the repository to it. Such paths can them be passed as arguments to plugins or used for any other
        purpose such as a stand-alone ANT target. In contrast, Maven appears to only support a fixed set of
        paths.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Multiple paths exported to the repository:</b> When an artifact is exported to the repository,
        it can define multiple paths of dependencies with it. e.g. "runtime" is the default path that
        usually refers to any dependencies the artifact has at runtime. However, there could be another
        path such as "runtime-jdk14" that includes additional libraries required when running with a
        jdk of 1.4 or below. In contrast, Maven only exports it's fixed set of paths, usually the runtime path only.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Extensibility via ANT targets &amp; tasks:</b> As quokka is essentially a plugin for ANT, it is possible
        to combine quokka targets with standard ANT targets. ANT targets can be stand-alone, or depend on or be a
        dependency of other targets. All standard ANT tasks are available, including optional tasks when
        the optional jars are referenced from the repository. Also, additional builtin ANT tasks have been provided
        including the for, if and switch task from ant-contrib. You can even bundle standard ANT tasks in dependency
        sets and use them like plugins. In contrast, maven has no native scripting language for extensions.
        An ant-run plugin does exist that allows some ANT functionality to be run before or after goals,
        but is limited in comparison and means your project ends up depending on both ANT and maven.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Fine control of dependency versions:</b> Quokka allows specific versions of dependencies
        to be overridden to prevent conflicts. e.g. "testng(qdox(log4j@1.2.15), bsh)" would include
        the standard testng dependencies, but override log4j to 1.2.15. It also supports global overrides,
        for example setting all log4j 1.2.x versions to 1.2.15. In constrast, Maven doesn't appear
        to allow overriding. It does however have automatic conflict resolution. Quokka avoids automated
        conflict resolution to ensure reproducible, deterministic behaviour.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>IDE/Tools integration:</b>
        Quokka is implemented as a transparent plugin to an unmodified version of ANT. It hooks into already
        existing extension points in ANT. This means for IDEs and other tools the use ANT quokka appears to
        be ANT (assuming you have control over the classpath used to launch ANT). The upshot is that
        for IDEs quokka integration comes essentially for free. Note: IDE integration is currently only tested
        for IntelliJ IDEA and works without modification. Eclipse and Netbeans have not been tested. In constrast,
        Maven requires specific plugins to be written for all tools and ides.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Dependency Sets versus inheritence:</b> Quokka allows build configurations to be composed
    of reusable configurations called dependency sets. Dependency sets may include dependencies,
        plugins, properties, imported ANT targets and build resources. For example, there is a standard
        Jar Dependency Set supplied with quokka that bundles together the plugins required to
        compile java sources, copy and filter resources and build a .jar file.
        Each project has a root dependency set, that may nest other dependency sets such as the Jar.
        Nested may nest other set to any level, providing a powerful composition model for
        reusing build configurations. In constrast, maven provides a single iheritance model that cannot
        handle build resources, or additional ad hoc targets.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Build Resources:</b> A build
        resource is essentially a reference to a file or directory that can bundled
        up with a plugin and then be overridden in either dependency sets or by placing the
        resources in the build/resources directory of the project. An example is the jalopy source code formatting
        plugin that requires an XML file of formatting rules. By specifying
        it as a build resource with a key of "jalopy-style.xml", it can be overridden in dependency sets.
        This allows, for example, a corporate-wide dependency set to be defined that includes the
        corporate code formatting rules. Maven has no such facility.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Multi-project flexibility: </b> Quokka's multi-project support is achieved using the subant task,
        together with a buildpath task that can take a path of build files and determine the
        interdependencies between them. This allows a great deal of flexibility such as building
        different subsets of children from the parent, auto-discovery of modules, or optionally building
        all the children before the parent. Maven supports mult-module builds, however it appears
        that all modules must be explictly defined an then executing a target always executes the same
        target on all modules.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Reproducibility</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Versioned Global Repository:</b>
        Artifacts in the global repository are immutable. If the metadata needs updating, then a different revision
        of the same artifact is created. This ensures that if an artifact is referenced from the global repository,
        exactly the same artifact will always be returned over time.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Plugin versions are fixed:</b>
        Plugins never "magically" upgrade themselves to new versions based
        on what is available in the repository at runtime. Plugin versions must be specified explicitly and do not
        change.
        Maven's default behaviour is to upgrade automatically which means plugins may upgrade without warning, breaking
        builds.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Bootstrapping:</b> Quokka supports multiple versions of itself to be installed simultaneously. Projects
        can then be configured to request a specific version of quokka and the bootstrapping process will
        automatically select the correct version. Bootstrapping can also select a particular JVM and heap size.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Robustness &amp; Agility</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b> The items below refer to <b>design</b> aspects that will impact robustness and
    agility <b>over time</b>. Maven as a product will be more robust than the initial quokka release.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Small code base:</b> Quokka plugins are generally a thin wrapper around existing ANT tasks and libraries,
        an therefore inherit the robustness of the ANT tasks. In contrast, Maven tends to rewrite plugins from
        scratch.
        <br/>TODO: Contrast compiler plugin implementations as an example
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Plugin targets run in completely isolated classloaders:</b></li>
    There is no possibility of a conflict
    between different versions of 3rd party libraries with regard to different targets. e.g. Jalopy
    and Cobertura plugins can use different versions of the ORO library and not conflict.
    <br/>
    <li><b>Development reports are not rewritten:</b> Quokka uses the native reports generated by tools such as
        jUnit and checkstyle. It does not rewrite them and attempt to massage them into a common look and feel.
        As most of the key reports such as unit tests and code coverage require frames in any case, rewriting them
        adds little value. In any case, using native reports means you have all the features of native reports
        immediately when a new version is released.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Development reports and site generation are separate:</b>
        Development reports and web sites usually have very different audiences. In fact, development reports
        would usually never be deployed to a web site with the exception of open source projects.
        As such, development reports are completely seperate in quokka. This means you don't waste time
        transforming a web site to get a new version of a development report.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>No standard definition of things such as mailing lists are built into the core:</b> Quokka project
        definitions do not include web site information in them. This allows the project core to be
        more stable than maven. Such information can be standardised in a site plugin for quokka if
        there is a need.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Repository definition seperate to the project definition:</b> Maven leaks it's pom.xml into the repository,
        including information about test libraries. Quokka repository definitions are completely seperate
        and have their own lifecycle indepependent of the project defintion.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fewer Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Core has no external dependencies:</b> The quokka core does not depend on any 3rd party libraries
        excluding ANT. As such there is a miminal chance of conflicts with project libraries.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Plugins do not introduce additional dependencies:</b> Quokka plugins do not introduce
        additional dependencies on 3rd party libraries (excluding libraries used in actually peforming the
        purpose of the plugin). For example, the maven javadoc plugin introduces a dependency on Apache's commons-lang
        library. Quokka plugins do not introduce such dependencies, attempting to keep the overall project dependencies
        to a minimum.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Dependencies are per target, not per plugin:</b> Quokka defines dependencies for each target within
        a plugin and allows the selective inclusion of individual targets. This means that if you are not using
        a subset of functionality from a plugin you don't need the dependencies for that subset. For example,
        a plugin might produce HTML and PDF reports. If you're not interested in PDF reports you could
        exclude the PDF target and automatically exclude the PDF dependencies as a result. In constrast,
        maven plugins define dependencies at a plugin level.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Dependency normalisation:</b> Versions of certain 3rd party libraries that are used by multiple
    plugins are judiciously "normalised" to the same version. e.g. All libraries using log4j might be
    bumped to 1.2.15. Care is taken to regression test any such changes.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Dependency comparison:</b> TODO ... compare the dependencies required by both frameworks for
        typical project types.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Key advantages of Maven:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Maturity:</b> Maven is a mature product with an active community. Quokka is newcomer currently in
        a beta phase with a small community.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Plugins:</b> The availability of plugins for Maven is far broader.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li><b>Global Repository:</b> Maven has a fairly comprehensive global repository. However, it suffers from
        maintenance issues, such as untimely updates. It also includes all transitive dependencies by default
        making it awkward to use.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Minor Quokka Advantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Code coverage without forking:</b> Quokka provides allows code coverage to be run without "forking"
        the build. This means you can get a coverage report without running your tests twice as is the case
        with maven.
    </li>
    <br/>
</ul>
